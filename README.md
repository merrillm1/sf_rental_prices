# Web Scraping Craigslist to Lower My Rent

With the continuing drop in rent prices accross San Francisco, and with the financial strain that transitioning careers has left me with , I decided to put my Data Science skills to good use and ask for an evidence based proposal of lowering my rent. This notebook is adapted from Riley Predum's (also a Springboard Data Science grad) [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-craigslist-a-complete-tutorial-c41cea4f4981) about web scraping craigslist using beautiful soup and has been adapted to suit my needs. The end goal of this project is to create a streamlit app that anyone can use to gather information about how their rent compares to the current market.

My situation is this, I currently have a 2 bedroom, 2 bath in the Richmond district of the city (SF) and I'd like to make the case that the average price of comparable units are below what I pay (3500) , that comparable units in my specific neighborhood are also lower,  and that there are a multitude of avalable options below $3500 that are also avalable not restricted to the parameters of my current living situation. This may be wishful thinking, and it is, but the goal is to build a case using any one or number of these options to increase the chances of convincing him.
